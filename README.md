# Local Weather App

Welcome to the Local Weather App! This is a legacy project under the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the Front-End Developer Track. This JavaScript app uses the Weather & Geocoder API to retrieve the userâ€™s current location and display the weather (can toggle between celsius and Fahrenheit) Note: weather reading is not available unless the user allows access. Location data will not be stored. You can view the project here:  [antofon.github.io/localweatherapp/](antofon.github.io/localweatherapp/)
